# User Behavior Analysis Notes

This repository contains independent analysis notes focused on understanding how users interact with digital systems, particularly under uncertainty, delay, or failure.

The emphasis is on **reasoning from observation**, not on survey data or experimentation. These notes aim to build intuition around user trust, friction, and decision-making.

## Areas Explored
- Onboarding friction and early abandonment
- Retry behavior under uncertainty
- The relationship between feedback clarity and trust

## Approach
- Identify a common user problem
- Reason about possible causes
- Connect system behavior to user response
- Form practical conclusions

## Limitations
- No empirical user studies
- No quantitative validation
- Focused on conceptual understanding
