# Trust and Feedback in Digital Systems

## Problem
User trust is often lost not because of failures, but because of unclear communication during failures.

## Observations
- Users tolerate delays better than uncertainty
- Transparent systems feel more reliable
- Consistent feedback builds confidence

## Feedback Characteristics That Build Trust
- Timeliness
- Clarity
- Consistency
- Honesty about system state

## Trade-offs
- Too much detail can overwhelm users
- Too little detail creates confusion

## Conclusion
Systems that communicate clearly during uncertainty maintain higher user trust, even when failures occur.
